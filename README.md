## The Brief
Your task is to:

-  choose a dataset or combination of datasets
-  develop some questions/aims related to that dataset, including appropriate background research
-  use R to address those questions/aims
-  write your findings into a report of up to 2000 words and 10 figures
-  summarise your findings in a poster which you will present in the week 12 workshop

Ideally, you should choose a combination of dataset and questions/aims that are interesting to you, because the more interesting you find it, the better your work will be!
