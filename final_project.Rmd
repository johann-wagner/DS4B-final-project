# Word/figure count

Words: [The number of words in your document, calculated using the word_count() function at the end of this document]
Figures: [The number of figures in your document. You can just count these]

# Location on GitHub

[A URL to the root directory of your final project on GitHub]

# Data Description

[A brief (~100-200 words should be more than enough) description of the dataset, referencing any key publications that go with it]

# Questions/Aims

[A brief section which first states and then justifies the questions/aims of your EDA. Must provide evidence of independent research into what has been done before on these questions/aims. See above for examples.]

# Raw data

[Explains how and where to get the exact raw data you got]
[Is reproducible by a person (required) and a machine (ideally)]

2. In your main .Rmd file make a Raw Data section
3. Write down in that how to get the raw data
• Note the DOI or URL for the data
• Give details of exactly which file(s) someone needs to download so that they could recreate
your raw_data folder

# Data wrangling

[R chunks and prose which:]
[Tidies up your raw data, outputs tidied_data.csv]
[Cleans up your tidied data, outputs cleaned_data.csv]

• loads in your excluded_data.csv file
• loads in your tidied_data.csv file
• removes the appropriate data from tidied_data.csv based on excluded_data.csv
• saves a new file called cleaned_data.csv

# Sanity checks

[R chunks and prose which perform sanity checks on your cleaned data]
[Remember that this really just summarises that your data are OK after you've cleaned them]
[Most of the real sanity checks and data cleaning go on in the data_cleaning.Rmd file]

• Include enough sanity checks to convince yourself (and whoever will be grading your work) that your data are clean
enough for your particular purposes
• You will never find and remove all errors, but you must be reasonably sure that you have found any errors which might
affect your conclusions

# Addressing the questions/aims

[This is the *main* section of your work. For example, if you are doing an EDA, this is where you would summarise it. If you are building something like a package or shiny app, a description of that package / app and demonstration of its function(s) would go here. Use appropriate sub-headings.]
