# Word/figure count

Words: [The number of words in your document, calculated using the word_count() function at the end of this document]
Figures: [The number of figures in your document. You can just count these]

# Location on GitHub

[A URL to the root directory of your final project on GitHub]

# Data Description

[A brief (~100-200 words should be more than enough) description of the dataset, referencing any key publications that go with it]

# Questions/Aims

[A brief section which first states and then justifies the questions/aims of your EDA. Must provide evidence of independent research into what has been done before on these questions/aims. See above for examples.]

# Raw data

[Explains how and where to get the exact raw data you got]
[Is reproducible by a person (required) and a machine (ideally)]

# Data wrangling

[R chunks and prose which:]
[Tidies up your raw data, outputs tidied_data.csv]
[Cleans up your tidied data, outputs cleaned_data.csv]

# Sanity checks

[R chunks and prose which perform sanity checks on your cleaned data]
[Remember that this really just summarises that your data are OK after you've cleaned them]
[Most of the real sanity checks and data cleaning go on in the data_cleaning.Rmd file]

# Addressing the questions/aims

[This is the *main* section of your work. For example, if you are doing an EDA, this is where you would summarise it. If you are building something like a package or shiny app, a description of that package / app and demonstration of its function(s) would go here. Use appropriate sub-headings.]
