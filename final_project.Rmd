# Data Description

The data used in this project is from The Atlas of Living Australia,
which is "a collaborative, digital and open infrastructure repository
that aggregates biodiversity data from multiple sources" ([ALA,
2022](https://support.ala.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000261410-introduction-to-the-ala)).

Specifically, this analysis uses species occurrence records for seven
invasive animal species:

1.  [European Rabbits (Oryctolagus
    cuniculus)](https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/692effa3-b719-495f-a86f-ce89e2981652)

2.  [European Red Foxes (Vulpes
    vulpes)](https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/2869ce8a-8212-46c2-8327-dfb7fabb8296)

3.  [Cane Toads (Rhinella
    marina)](https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/e79179f8-44bf-46eb-b139-a2e66f6045c1)

4.  [Feral Cats (Felis
    catus)](https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/7de6b16a-f854-4b4b-88cf-81868ce74ad8)

5.  [Feral Horses (Equus (Equus)
    caballus)](https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/86b4395d-97a7-470d-b35b-306e01dfbab6)

6.  [Feral Pigs (Sus
    scrofa)](https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/948d8ca1-62fc-4d03-a79d-4be2de837264)

7.  [Red Imported Fire Ants (Solenopsis
    invicta)](https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/5b3fe1c6-1c2c-4e20-819f-2e6d8fa3d332)

I was interested in the spatial and temporal variables for all 7
species, particularly the longitude and latitude values
(`decimalLongitude` and `decimalLatitude`) and date of recording
(`eventDate`) for each record.

# Questions/Aims

[A brief section which first states and then justifies the
questions/aims of your EDA. Must provide evidence of independent
research into what has been done before on these questions/aims. See
above for examples.]

START BROAD PREDATOR PREY

# Raw data

[Explains how and where to get the exact raw data you got] [Is
reproducible by a person (required) and a machine (ideally)]

2.  In your main .Rmd file make a Raw Data section
3.  Write down in that how to get the raw data • Note the DOI or URL for
    the data • Give details of exactly which file(s) someone needs to
    download so that they could recreate your raw_data folder

# Data wrangling

[R chunks and prose which:] [Tidies up your raw data, outputs
tidied_data.csv] [Cleans up your tidied data, outputs cleaned_data.csv]

• loads in your excluded_data.csv file • loads in your tidied_data.csv
file • removes the appropriate data from tidied_data.csv based on
excluded_data.csv • saves a new file called cleaned_data.csv

# Sanity checks

[R chunks and prose which perform sanity checks on your cleaned data]
[Remember that this really just summarises that your data are OK after
you've cleaned them] [Most of the real sanity checks and data cleaning
go on in the data_cleaning.Rmd file]

• Include enough sanity checks to convince yourself (and whoever will be
grading your work) that your data are clean enough for your particular
purposes • You will never find and remove all errors, but you must be
reasonably sure that you have found any errors which might affect your
conclusions

# Addressing the questions/aims

FINISH BROAD

[This is the *main* section of your work. For example, if you are doing
an EDA, this is where you would summarise it. If you are building
something like a package or shiny app, a description of that package /
app and demonstration of its function(s) would go here. Use appropriate
sub-headings.]
